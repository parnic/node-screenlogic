# node-screenlogic

This is a Node.JS module for interfacing with Pentair ScreenLogic systems over your local network or remotely through the Pentair dispatcher. Local connections require a Pentair ScreenLogic device on the same network (a network which supports UDP broadcasts).

Tested with a Pentair ScreenLogic system on firmware versions 5.2 Build 736.0 Rel, 5.2 Build 738.0 Rel

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/parnic/node-screenlogic/wiki/2.0) for information on migrating from v1 to v2.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I no longer have a ScreenLogic system as I've upgraded to Pentair's newest controller, IntelliCenter. As such, I won't be able to maintain the library any longer. Please see <https://github.com/parnic/node-intellicenter> for the IntelliCenter version of this library.

## Usage

See example.ts for an example of interfacing with the library. Broadly, import the library with

```javascript
import * as Screenlogic from "node-screenlogic";
```

Individual named imports can also be used. Then for local connections create a new ScreenLogic unit finder with

```javascript
let finder = new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();
let localUnit = await finder.searchAsync();
return Promise.resolve(localUnit);
```

If you prefer to use an event-based approach, you can hook the `serverFound` event with:

```javascript
finder.on('serverFound', function(server) { console.log(server); });
await finder.searchAsync();
```

and call it via `searchAsync()`. This performs a UDP broadcast on 255.255.255.255, port 1444, so ensure your network supports UDP broadcasts and the device is on the same subnet.

Alternatively, to find a unit remotely, create a new ScreenLogic remote login with

```javascript
let gateway = new ScreenLogic.RemoteLogin(systemName);  // systemName in the format "Pentair: xx-xx-xx"
let unit = await gateway.connectAsync();
if (!unit || !unit.gatewayFound || unit.ipAddr === '') {
  logger.error(`Screenlogic: No unit found called ${systemName}`);
  return;
}
await gateway.closeAsync();
```

and call it via `connectAsync()`. This opens a TCP connection to screenlogicserver.pentair.com, port 500.

When a local or remote server is found, create and connect to a new UnitConnection with

```javascript
let client = ScreenLogic.screenlogic;
client.init(systemName, ipAddr, port, password);  // ipAddr and password as strings; port as integer
await client.connectAsync();
```

where `password` is the remote login password.

Once you've connected with `connectAsync()`, there are a number of methods available and corresponding events for when they've completed successfully. See [screenlogic](#unitconnection) API reference.

All communication with a ScreenLogic unit is done via TCP, so responses will come back in the order they were requested.

## Notes

Contributions welcome. There are lots of available messages supported by ScreenLogic that the app doesn't support yet, but can be added pretty easily as needed.

## Packet format

All ScreenLogic packets are sent with an 8-byte header. The first 2 bytes are a little-endian-encoded sender ID (which is normally specified when making the original request). The second 2 bytes are a little-endian-encoded message ID. The final 4 bytes are a little-endian-encoded length of the data payload on the packet. The data payload is handled per-message.

## API Reference

Pull requests to document undocumented properties are most welcome.

### FindUnits

#### constructor()

Examples:

```javascript
import * as Screenlogic from 'node-screenlogic';
/*or
const ScreenLogic = require('node-screenlogic');
*/
var finder = new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();
```

#### search()

Issues one UDP broadcast search for available units. Since this is a stateless UDP query, the connection will not automatically be closed, so you may need to issue another search if the first one doesn't work, if your network connection is not established, etc. There is no automatic timeout built in to this command. This call does not return any found units directly, but does emit the `serverFound` message which contains each LocalUnit object that is found:

* `address` - ip address string
* `type` - integer
* `port` - integer, the port to connect to
* `gatewayType` - integer
* `gatewaySubtype` - integer
* `gatewayName` - the gateway/unit name as a string

#### searchAsync(searchTimeMs?)

Issues one UDP broadcast search for available units. This is a stateless UDP query, but the connection will automatically be closed, so you may need to issue another search if the first one doesn't work, if your network connection is not established, etc. There is a 5s timeout built in to this command, and no retry mechanism.

Optionally accepts a number of milliseconds to wait for units; defaults to 5000 if not specified. Returns a LocalUnit[] array with each object containing:

* `address` - ip address string
* `type` - integer
* `port` - integer, the port to connect to
* `gatewayType` - integer
* `gatewaySubtype` - integer
* `gatewayName` - the gateway/unit name as a string

This async call will also emit the `serverFound` message.

#### close()

Closes the socket. Only needed for search(). searchAsync() will close the socket itself.

#### Events

* `close` - Indicates that `close()` has been called on the finder.
* `error` - Indicates that an unhandled error was caught (such as the connection timing out).
* `serverFound` - Indicates that a ScreenLogic unit has been found. Event handler receives a [UnitConnection](#unitconnection) object. The async call is a wrapper for this event.

Examples:

```javascript
let finder = new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();
let localUnit = await finder.searchAsync();
// or hook the event if you don't assign the function to a variable
finder.on('serverFound', function(server) {
  // server object will contain connection information
})
```

### RemoteLogin

#### constructor(systemName)

Argument is the name of a system to connect to in "Pentair: xx-xx-xx" format.

Example:

```javascript
let gateway = new ScreenLogic.RemoteLogin(systemName);  // systemName in the format "Pentair: xx-xx-xx"
let unit = await gateway.connectAsync();
if (!unit || !unit.gatewayFound || unit.ipAddr === '') {
  logger.error(`Screenlogic: No unit found called ${systemName}`);
  return;
}
await gateway.closeAsync();
// or use the emit if you don't assign the function to a variable
```

#### connectAsync()

Connects to the dispatcher service and searches for the unit passed to its constructor.

#### closeAsync()

Closes the connection and removes all listeners.

#### Events

* `close` - Indicates that the connection to the remote login server has been closed. Event handler receives a bool indicating whether there was a transmission error.
* `end` - Indicates the socket has terminated.
* `error` - Indicates that an unhandled error was caught (such as the connection timing out).
* `timeout` - Indicates the socket timed out.
* `clientError` - Indicates an error with the client on the other end of the socket.
* `gatewayFound` - Indicates that the search for the named unit has completed (may or may not be successful). Event handler receives a [SLReceiveGatewayDataMessage](#slreceivegatewaydatamessage) argument. The async function is a promise that wraps this event.

### UnitConnection

#### Module

`screenlogic` is an exported module that maintains state and connection for a given unit. Parameters are initialized with the `init` and connections are made with the `connectAsync` functions.

Examples:

```javascript
let client = ScreenLogic.screenlogic;
client.init(systemName, unit.ipAddr, unit.port, password);
await client.connectAsync();
```

#### init(systemName, address, port, password, senderId?)

Takes the parameters `(systemName, address, port, password, senderId?)`

systemName is a string. Port is an integer. Address is an IPv4 address of the server as a string. Password is optional; should be the 4-digit password in string form, e.g. `'1234'`.

`senderId` can be set once (or it defaults to 0) and will be present as the `senderId` field on the returned message.

Examples:

```javascript
client.init('Pentair: 00-00-00', '10.0.0.85', 80, '1234', senderId?);
```

#### initUnit(localUnit)

Helper method for [init](#initsystemname-address-port-password-senderid). Takes a `LocalUnit` remote login object and passes the appropriate values to `init`.

#### connectAsync()

Connects to the server after `init` parameters are set.

Examples:

```javascript
await client.connectAsync();
```

#### closeAsync()

Closes the connection and removes all listeners.

#### addClientAsync(clientId?, senderid?)

Registers to receive updates from controller when something changes. Takes a random number `clientId` (if passed, or will be randomly assigned) to identify the client. Resolves/emits the `addClient` event when the request to add a client is acknowledged. As long as this client is connected, various events will be emitted when something changes on the controller, such as `equipmentState` or `chemicalData`.

#### getVersionAsync(senderId?)

Requests the system version string from the connected unit. Resolves/emits the `version` event when the response comes back.

#### pingServerAsync(senderId?)

Sends a ping to the server to keep the connection alive. Resolves/emits the `pong` event when the response comes back.

#### reconnectAsync()

Will be automatically called if node-screenlogic detects an error in communications, but can also be called manually to re-establish communications.

#### removeClientAsync(clientId)

No longer receive update messages from controller. Resolves/emits the `removeClient` event when the request to remove a client is acknowledged. `clientId` must match a client previously registered via [addClientAsync()](#addclientasyncclientid-senderid).

#### status()

Returns an object with the socket state:

* `destroyed` - boolean indicating if the socket has been destroyed
* `connecting` - boolean indicating if the socket is in a connecting state
* `timeout` - optional boolean indicating if the socket timed out
* `readyState` - [string](https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v16/net/#socketreadystate)

### Body

#### decodeTime(time)

Interprets a time integer recorded as minutes past midnight and returns the ScreenLogic string representation of it in 24-hour time.

#### encodeTime(time)

Interprets the string representing 24-hour time and returns an integer of minutes past midnight.

#### decodeDayMask(mask)

Converts a day mask from, for example, `SLGetScheduleData`'s events[idx].days property into a `DAY_VALUES` array for ease of use.

#### encodeDayMask(days)
