# node-screenlogic

This is a Node.JS module for interfacing with Pentair ScreenLogic systems over your local network or remotely through the Pentair dispatcher. Local connections require a Pentair ScreenLogic device on the same network (a network which supports UDP broadcasts).

Tested with a Pentair ScreenLogic system on firmware versions 5.2 Build 736.0 Rel, 5.2 Build 738.0 Rel

Breaking changes in 2.0:

* Async functions are wrappers around the remote calls.  All of the previous events are still present and should still be added to the listeners if you want to account for changes being broadcast from the ScreenLogic unit.
* All indexes are now 1 based.  Previously, indexes would refer to the internal Pentair numbering scheme (500 for circuits, 700 for schedules, 0 for bodies and pumps, etc).
* Data that was previously in arrays (body temperatures, air temperatures, etc) are now returned as objects with the attributes associated to the pool equipment

## Usage

See example.ts for an example of interfacing with the library. Broadly, import the library with

```javascript
import * as Screenlogic from "./index";
```

Individual named imports can also be used.  Then for local connections create a new ScreenLogic unit finder with

```javascript
let finder = new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();
let localUnit = await finder.searchAsync();
return Promise.resolve(localUnit);
```

For backwards compatibility, every event from the original API is still available.  You could, for example, hook the `serverFound` event with

```javascript
.on('serverFound', function(server) { })
await finder.searchAsync();
```

and call it via `searchAsync()`. This performs a UDP broadcast on 255.255.255.255, port 1444, so ensure your network supports UDP broadcasts and the device is on the same subnet.

Alternatively, to find a unit remotely, create a new ScreenLogic remote login with

```javascript
let gateway = new ScreenLogic.RemoteLogin(systemName);  // systemName in the format "Pentair: xx-xx-xx"
let unit = await this._gateway.connectAsync();
if (!unit || !unit.gatewayFound || unit.ipAddr === '') {
  logger.error(`Screenlogic: No unit found called ${systemName}`);
  return;
}
await this._gateway.closeAsync();
```

and call it via `connectAsync()`. This opens a TCP connection to screenlogicserver.pentair.com, port 500.

When a local or remote server is found, create and connect to a new UnitConnection with

```javascript
let client = ScreenLogic.screenlogic;
client.init(systemName, ipAddr, port, password);  // ipAddr and password as strings; port as integere
await client.connectAsync();
```

where `password` is the remote login password.

Once you've connected with `connectAsync()`, there are a number of methods available and corresponding events for when they've completed successfully. See [screenlogic](#unitconnection) API reference.

All communication with a ScreenLogic unit is done via TCP, so responses will come back in the order they were requested.

## Notes

Contributions welcome. There are lots of available messages supported by ScreenLogic that the app doesn't support yet, but can be added pretty easily as needed.

## Packet format

All ScreenLogic packets are sent with an 8-byte header. The first 2 bytes are a little-endian-encoded sender ID (which is normally specified when making the original request). The second 2 bytes are a little-endian-encoded message ID. The final 4 bytes are a little-endian-encoded length of the data payload on the packet. The data payload is handled per-message.

## API Reference

Pull requests to document undocumented properties are most welcome.

### FindUnits

#### constructor()

Examples:

```javascript
import * as Screenlogic from 'node-screenlogic';
/*or
const ScreenLogic = require('node-screenlogic');
*/
var finder = new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();
```

#### searchAsync()

Issues one UDP broadcast search for available units. This is a stateless UDP query, but the connection will automatically be closed, so you may need to issue another search if the first one doesn't work, if your network connection is not established, etc. There is a 5s timeout built in to this command, and no retry mechanism.
Returns a LocalUnit[] array containing:
```
  address, // ip address
  type,
  port,
  gatewayType,
  gatewaySubtype,
  gatewayName
```
This async call will also emit the `serverFound` message.

#### search()

Issues one UDP broadcast search for available units. Since this is a stateless UDP query, the connection will not automatically be closed, so you may need to issue another search if the first one doesn't work, if your network connection is not established, etc. There is no automatic timeout built in to this command.  This call does not return any found units directly, but does emit the `serverFound` message which contains each LocalUnit object that is found:
```
  address, // ip address
  type,
  port,
  gatewayType,
  gatewaySubtype,
  gatewayName
```

#### close()

Closes the socket.  Only needed for search().  searchAsync() will close the socket.

#### Events

* `close` - Indicates that `close()` has been called on the finder.
* `error` - Indicates that an unhandled error was caught.
* `serverFound` - Indicates that a ScreenLogic unit has been found. Event handler receives a [`UnitConnection`](#unitconnection) object.  The async call is a wrapper for this event.

Examples:

```javascript
let finder = new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();
let localUnit = await finder.searchAsync();
// or hook the event if you don't assign the function to a variable
finder.on('serverFound', function(server) {
  // server object will contain connection information
})
```

* `error` - Indicates that an unhandled error was caught (such as the connection timing out)

### RemoteLogin

#### constructor(systemName)

Argument is the name of a system to connect to in "Pentair: xx-xx-xx" format.

Example:

```javascript
let gateway = new ScreenLogic.RemoteLogin(systemName);  // systemName in the format "Pentair: xx-xx-xx"
let unit = await this._gateway.connectAsync();
if (!unit || !unit.gatewayFound || unit.ipAddr === '') {
  logger.error(`Screenlogic: No unit found called ${systemName}`);
  return;
}
await this._gateway.closeAsync();
// or use the emit if you don't assign the function to a variable
```

#### connectAsync()

Connects to the dispatcher service and searches for the unit passed to its constructor.

#### closeAsync()

Closes the connection and removes all listeners.

#### Events

* `close` - Indicates that the connection to the remote login server has been closed. Event handler receives a bool indicating whether there was a transmission error.
* `end` - Indicates the socket has terminated.
* `error` - Indicates that an unhandled error was caught (such as the connection timing out).
* `timeout` - Indicates the socket timed out.
* `clientError` - Indicates an error with the client on the other end of the socket.
* `gatewayFound` - Indicates that the search for the named unit has completed (may or may not be successful). Event handler receives a [`SLGetGatewayDataMessage`](#slgetgatewaydatamessage) argument.  The async function is a promise that wraps this event.

### UnitConnection

#### Module 

`screenlogic` is an exported module that maintains state and connection for a given unit.  Parameters are initialized with the `init` and connections are made with the `connectAsync` functions.

Examples:

```javascript
let client = ScreenLogic.screenlogic;
client.init(systemName, unit.ipAddr, unit.port, password);
await client.connectAsync();
```

#### init(systemName, address, port, password, senderId?)

Takes the parameters `(systemName, address, port, password, senderId?)`

systemName is a string. Port is an integer. Address is an IPv4 address of the server as a string. Password is optional; should be the 4-digit password in string form, e.g. `'1234'`.

Previously, `senderId` would be an optional 16-bit integer that can be added to each function call.  Now, senderId can be set once (or it will be assigned randomly) and will be present as the `senderId` field on the returned message.

Examples:

```javascript
client.init('Pentair: 00-00-00', '10.0.0.85', 80, '1234', senderId?);
```

#### initUnit(localUnit)

Helper method for [init](#initsystemname-address-port-password-senderid).  Takes a `LocalUnit` remote login object and passes the appropriate values to `init`.

#### initMock(systemName, address, port, password, senderId?)

This method is the same as init, but it does not initialize the network communications.

Takes the parameters `(systemName, address, port, password, senderId?)`

systemName is a string. Port is an integer. Address is an IPv4 address of the server as a string. Password is optional; should be the 4-digit password in string form, e.g. `'1234'`.

Previously, `senderId` would be an optional 16-bit integer that can be added to each function call.  Now, senderId can be set once (or it will be assigned randomly) and will be present as the `senderId` field on the returned message.

Examples:

```javascript
client.init('Pentair: 00-00-00', '10.0.0.85', 80, '1234', senderId?);
```

#### getVersionAsync(senderId?)

Requests the system version string from the connected unit. Resolves/emits the `version` event when the response comes back.


#### pingServerAsync(senderId?)

Sends a ping to the server to keep the connection alive. Resolves/emits the `pong` event when the response comes back.


#### connectAsync()

Connects to the server after `init` parameters are set.

Examples:

```javascript
await client.connectAsync();
```

#### reconnectAsync()

Will be automatically called if node-screenlogic detects an error in communications, but can also be called manually to re-establish communications.

#### closeAsync()

Closes the connection and removes all listeners.

#### addClientAsync(clientId?, senderid?)

Registers to receive updates from controller when something changes. Takes a random number `clientId` (if passed, or will be randomly assigned) to identify the client. Resolves/emits the `equipmentState` event when something changes on the controller, and the `addClient` event when the request to add a client is acknowledged. 

#### removeClientAsync(clientId)

No longer receive `equipmentState` messages from controller. Resolves/emits the `removeClient` event when the request to remove a client is acknowledged. Takes a random number `clientId` that should match a previously registered client with `addClient`.

#### status()

Returns an object with the socket state:
```
{
  destroyed: boolean,
  connecting: boolean,
  timeout: boolean,
  readyState: [string](https://nodejs.dev/en/api/v16/net/#socketreadystate)
}
```

### Body

#### body.setHeatModeAsync(bodyId, heatMode, senderId?)

This is information about the pH and ORP readings over time and when pH and ORP feeds were turned on and off. `fromTime` is the time (as a Javascript Date object) that you want to get events from and `toTime` is the time (as a Javascript Date object) that you want to get events until. If omitted, data will be resolved for the past 24 hours.  Emits the `getChemHistoryDataPending` event when the request to get data is confirmed, then the `getChemHistoryData` event when the chemical history data is actually ready to be handled.  Resolves with `SLChemHistory`.
